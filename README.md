# SolisProject

This is my first mobile application I created using React Native. 

This mobile app is dedicated to Simpsons fans everywhere! You can browse profiles, pictures, and vote for Sundayâ€™s episode.

Instead of using a 3rd-party API, I created two json files: one was with basic character information and the other with images of the characters.
I was able to pull that data in dynamically and display the information for each character's profiles and images in a seperate gallery. 

Tech stack: React Native, React Native Video, React Native Navigation, AsyncStorage, React Native Elements, Lottie React Native.
